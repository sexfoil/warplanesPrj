        <p>
			A military aircraft is any fixed-wing or rotary-wing 
			aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary 
			armed service of any type. Military aircraft can 
			be either combat or non-combat:			
			<br/>
			Combat aircraft are designed to destroy enemy equipment using their own aircraft ordnance. 
			Combat aircraft are normally developed and procured only by military forces.
			<br/>
			Non-combat aircraft are not designed for combat as their primary function, 
			but may carry weapons for self-defense. These mainly operate in support roles, 
			and may be developed by either military forces or civilian organizations.

          <p>
			In the 100th year of powered manned flight, it is appropriate that we step back and 
			review the evolution of military aviation and look ahead to the future. 
			How did the United States achieve its current dominance in the air? 
			I believe many factors have played a role - innovations by aerospace engineers from many nations, 
			the visionary ideas of a few individuals, and the means (and willingness) to spend significant 
			portions of our wealth on military equipment. America was founded by people seeking to distance 
			themselves from relatively static societies, people attracted to building 
			a new land and developing a new society. The spirit of these individuals, as embodied 
			in Americaâ€™s engineers, is largely responsible for our success as a nation and particularly 
			for our success as aviation innovators.

			(CNN) The undisputed superstar of the skies -- the biggest airplane in the world -- 
			is taking flight on a rare delivery mission across three continents.</br>
			The Ukrainian cargo jet named "Mriya" is one of a kind. There is no other.</br>
			That's why the gawkers showed up Tuesday in Prague. They watched in awe as this big 
			boy defied gravity before it touched down at Vaclav Havel Airport in the Czech Republic.</br>
			Officially designated as the Antonov An-225, the plane was developed in the 1980s 
			to carry the Soviet version of the space shuttle on its back.
